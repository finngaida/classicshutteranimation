# ClassicShutterAnimation
Mini-tweak that brings back the pre-iOS 7 shutter animation to the camera

## Attention!
This tweak only works on iOS 9.0 - 9.1 and the sole reason I open sourced it was so that hopefully someone will find the time to crawl into the iOS 9.3.3 / 10 headers and find a way to make it work again.
